Quick Start
Install repo command from Google if not available on your host system. Please follow the official instructions by Google.

Then install a number of packages for BitBake (OE build tool) to work properly on your host system. BitBake itself depends on Python 3. Once you have Python 3 installed BitBake should be able to tell you most of the missing packages.

For Ubuntu 18.04 (or newer) install python3-distutils package.

Detailed instructions for various distributions can be found in "Required Packages for the Build Host" section in Yocto Project Reference Manual.


Creating Workspace
This needs to be done every time you want a clean setup based on the latest layers.

mkdir riscv-sifive && cd riscv-sifive
repo init -u git://github.com/sifive/meta-sifive -b 2021.09 -m tools/manifests/sifive.xml
(here may hit some problem about python, try below command:
$ mkdir -p ~/.bin
$ PATH="${HOME}/.bin:${PATH}"
$ curl https://storage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/.bin/repo
$ chmod a+rx ~/.bin/repo
)
repo sync
